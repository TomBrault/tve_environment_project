# tve_environment_project

This project is an analysis of extreme values based on Valencia precipitation indicators (1937-2024). 

The code is provided in the main branch in the R file. Datasets are also available with the txt extension.

Note that the humidity dataset is not studied in the report. We made this choice as the number of missing values was very important.
